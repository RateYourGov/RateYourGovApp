## Solution Image Editor Item Folder

This folder contains _Image Editor versions of image files_, for instance Adobe Photoshop .psd files. 

**NB: These files are not meant to be used directly by any Project in the Solution.** 

The primary purpose is to _store_ editable image source files in the repository so that they can be checked out and edited.  
Resulting Images themselves should be stored in the *Shared\Images* folder using the naming convention described in (..\Images\About.md).
